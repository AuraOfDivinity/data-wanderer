# AWS Lambda Functions for Beginners - 1

## Introduction

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code isn't running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Lambda is a great service for running your code without managing servers. It is easy to use, scales automatically, and is cost effective. You can run code for virtually any type of application in response to events using Lambda.

Lambda allows you to run code in response to events without managing servers or infrastructure. You simply write your code, upload it to Lambda, and Lambda takes care of automatically and instantly provisioning computing resources to run your code. Your code is run on high-availability compute resources and automatically scales up and down based on the traffic to your application. You pay only for the compute time used to run your code and there is no charge when your code is not running. Lambda's free tier also allows you to get started with Lambda for free for simple applications.

## Easy to Use

AWS Lambda is extremely easy to use. You simply upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. There is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need to provision or continuously monitor server resources. Just write your code and upload it to Lambda. Lambda will automatically handle computing resources for you, so you can focus on your code.

You can set up your code to automatically run in response to events, such as changes in data, streams, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, and more. Your code will scale automatically and Lambda provides all the compute resources required to run your code. There is no need to provision or continuously monitor server resources.

Using Lambda is as simple as uploading your code, configuring your events and triggers, and letting Lambda do the rest. Lambda supports Node.js, Python, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, and C/C++. You can also use languages and libraries that run on the Java Virtual Machine, such as Kotlin. This makes it easy to get started with a language you already know.

## Scales Automatically

Lambda automatically scales your code and provides all the compute resources required to run your code. There is no need to provision or continuously monitor server resources. You just write your code and upload it to Lambda. Lambda will scale your compute resources up and down automatically based on the traffic to your application. This ensures a responsive experience for your users, even during traffic spikes.

Lambda's scaling is seamless - it can scale up to thousands of instances to meet your demand and scale down to zero when the traffic to your application decreases. This on-demand scaling ensures you only pay for the resources you use.

Lambda's scaling is instant and near real-time. It can scale from zero to thousands of instances within milliseconds based on the traffic to your application. This instant scaling allows your application to handle unpredictable traffic spikes and remain responsive.

## Cost Effective

With AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time you consume. There is no charge when your code isn't running. Lambda's free tier provides up to 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month. This allows you to get started with Lambda for free and stay within the free tier limits for simple applications. Beyond the free tier, Lambda charges $0.00001667 for every GB-second used and the number of requests are charged at $0.20 per 1 million requests. The cost is very low for running simple code and you don't pay anything when your code is not running. Since Lambda scales automatically, you only pay for the resources your code actually uses. Lambda's per-request pricing and millisecond billing allow you to optimize your costs. You can also reduce costs by configuring your code to pause itself when idle. Lambda's cost effectiveness and instant scaling allows you to run code that would otherwise be cost prohibitive on traditional servers. You get the flexibility to run code for any workload without managing servers or paying for idle resources.

## Conclusion

AWS Lambda is a great service for running your code without managing servers. It is easy to use, scales automatically, is cost effective, and allows you to run code for virtually any type of application in response to events. Lambda allows you to run code instantly in response to events without managing servers or infrastructure. Your code scales automatically based on traffic and you pay only for the compute time used to run your code. I hope this longer introduction to AWS Lambda functions was helpful!
